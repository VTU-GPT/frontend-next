An image is captured by \na  sensor  (such  as  digital  camera)  and  digitized.  The  image  that  is acquired  is completely \nunprocessed. This step involves preprocessing such as scaling.  \nImage  enhancement: It is  the  process  of  manipulating  an  image  in  order  to  make image  more \nsuitable than the original  for the specific application. The  image enhancement techniques are so \nverified, and use so many different image processing approaches. The idea behind enhancement \ntechniques  is to bring out detail that is  hidden, or simply to highlight certain  features of  interest \nin an image like changing brightness & contrast etc. \nImage restoration: It is an area that also deals with improving the appearance of an image but it \nis  objective  than  subjective,  in  the  sense  that  restoration  techniques  tend  to  be  based  on \nmathematical or probabilistic models of image degradation.  \nColor  image  processing: It  is  an  area  that  has  been  gaining  in  importance  because  of  the \nsignificant increase in the use of digital images over the internet. Color is used also for extracting \nfeatures  of  interest  in  an  image. This  may  include  color  modeling  and  processing  in  a  digital \ndomain etc.  \nWWW.VTULOOP.COM","metadata":{"source":"D:\\WebDev\\vtugpt-next\\pages\\api\\documents\\Module 1 [www.vtuloop.com] (1).pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.5","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Title":"Digital Image Processing                                                                                                          Module 1","Author":"Sandesh","Creator":"Microsoft® Word 2016","Producer":"www.ilovepdf.com","CreationDate":"D:20180918114405+00'00'","ModDate":"D:20180918114405Z"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":14},"loc":{"pageNumber":2}}}],["8af3b0a8-dabc-461e-b790-b098ad276fa1",{"pageContent":"3 \nDigital Image Processing                                                                                                          Module 1 \n \nwritetokaranth@gmail.com1| rkk4691@gmail.com\n \n                                                        | VCET, Puttur \n \nWavelets: These  are  the  foundation  for  representing  images  in  various  degrees  of  resolution.  In \nparticular  used  for  image  data  compression  and  for  pyramidal  representation,  in  which  images \nare subdivided successively into smaller regions.  \nCompression: Deals with techniques for reducing the storage required to saving an image, or the \nbandwidth  required  to  transmit  it.  An  example  for  image  compression  standard is  jpg  file \nextension used in the JPEG(Joint Photographic Experts Group) image compression standard. \nMorphological processing: It deals with tools for extracting image components that are useful in \nthe representation and description of shape.  \nSegmentation: Segmentation procedures partition an image into its constituent’s parts or objects. \nIn  general,  autonomous  segmentation  is  one  of  the  most  difficult  task  in  digital  processing.  A \nrugged  segmentation  procedure  brings  the  process  a  long  way  towards  successful  solution  of \nimaging  problems  that require  objects to  be  identified  individually. On  the other  hand,  weak  or \nerratic segmentation algorithms always guarantee eventual failure.  \nRepresentation  and  description: It  follows  the  output  of  the  segmentation  stage,  which  is  raw \npixel data it’s needed to convert it to a form suitable for computer processing. The first decision \nthat must be made is whether the data should be represented as a boundary (i.e., the set of pixels \nseparating one image region from another) or as a complete region. \n The  boundary  representation  is  appropriate  when  the  focus  is  on  external  shape \ncharacteristics, such as corners and inflections. \n The regional representation is appropriate when the focus is on internal properties, such \nas texture or skeletal shape. \nDescription  also  called  feature  selection,  deals  with  extracting  attributes  that  result  in  some \nquantitative  information  of  interest  or  are  basic  for  differentiating  one  class  of  objects  from \nanother. \nRecognition: It  is  the process  that  assigns a  label  (e.g.,  ‘vehicle’) to  an  object  based  on  its \ndescriptors.  \n \nWWW.VTULOOP.COM","metadata":{"source":"D:\\WebDev\\vtugpt-next\\pages\\api\\documents\\Module 1 [www.vtuloop.com] (1).pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.5","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Title":"Digital Image Processing                                                                                                          Module 1","Author":"Sandesh","Creator":"Microsoft® Word 2016","Producer":"www.ilovepdf.com","CreationDate":"D:20180918114405+00'00'","ModDate":"D:20180918114405Z"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":14},"loc":{"pageNumber":3}}}],["46904adb-642f-4966-bc52-6b91d672d700",{"pageContent":"4 \nDigital Image Processing                                                                                                          Module 1 \n \nwritetokaranth@gmail.com1| rkk4691@gmail.com\n \n                                                        | VCET, Puttur \n \nComponents of an Image Processing System** \n Network \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nProblem domain \nFigure 1.2 Components of a general – purpose image processing system. \nThe above figure shows the basic components comprising a typical general purpose system used \nfor  digital  image  processing.

This  type  of  hardware  is  called  a front  end \nsubsystem, and its most distinguished characteristic is speed, so this unit performs functions that \nrequire fast data throughputs that the typical main computer cannot handle.  \nThe Computer in an  image processing system  is a general purpose computer and can range \nfrom a PC to a supercomputer. In dedicated applications, sometimes custom computers are used \nto achieve a required level of performance.  \nSoftware for image processing consists of specialized modules that perform specific tasks. A \nwell designed package also  includes the capacity  for the user to write code that, as a minimum, \nutilizes the specialized modules.  \nMass  storage capacity  is  a  must  in image  processing  applications.  An  image  1024  X  1024 \npixels, in which the intensity of each pixel is an 8-bit quantity, requires one megabyte of storage \nspace if the image is not compressed. When dealing with thousands, or even millions, of images, \nproviding  adequate  storage  in  an  image  processing  applications  falls  into  three  principal \ncategories:  \n1. Short term storage for use during processing \n2. Online storage for relatively fast recall \n3. Archival storage, characterized by infrequent access.  \nStorage  is  measured  in  bytes,  Kbytes,  Mbytes,  Gbytes,  Tbytes.  One  method  of  providing \nshort  term  storage  is  computer  memory.  An-other  is  by  specialized  buffers,  that  store  one  or \nmore images and can be accessed rapidly, usually at video buffers, that store one or more images \nand   can   be   accessed rapidly,   usually   at   video   rates.  The   latter   method   allows   virtually \ninstantaneous  image  zoom,  as  well  as  scroll  (vertical  shifts)  and  pan  (horizontal  shifts).  Online \nstorage  generally  takes  the  form  of  magnetic  disks or  optical  image  storage.  The  key  factor \ncharacterizing the online storage is frequent access to the stored data. Magnetic tapes and optical \ndisks housed in ‘jukeboxes’ are the usual media for the archival applications.  \nWWW.VTULOOP.COM","metadata":{"source":"D:\\WebDev\\vtugpt-next\\pages\\api\\documents\\Module 1 [www.vtuloop.com] (1).pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.5","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Title":"Digital Image Processing                                                                                                          Module 1","Author":"Sandesh","Creator":"Microsoft® Word 2016","Producer":"www.ilovepdf.com","CreationDate":"D:20180918114405+00'00'","ModDate":"D:20180918114405Z"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":14},"loc":{"pageNumber":5}}}],["b39523c3-202e-48e7-80ed-39e867e5069b",{"pageContent":"6 \nDigital Image Processing                                                                                                          Module 1 \n \nwritetokaranth@gmail.com1| rkk4691@gmail.com\n \n                                                        | VCET, Puttur \n \nImage  displays in  use  today  are  mainly  color  TV  monitors.  Monitors  are  driven  by  the \noutputs of  image  and  graphic  display  cards  that  are  an  integral  part  of  the  computer  system. In \nsome cases it is necessary to have stereo displays, and these are implemented in the form of head \ngear containing two small displays embedded in goggles worn by the users.  \nHardcopy devices  for  recording  images  include  laser  printers,  film  cameras,  heat-sensitive \ndevices,  inject  units,  such  as  optical  and  CD  ROM  disks.

To convert it to digital \nform,  we  have  sampled  the  function  in  both  coordinates  and  in  amplitude.  Digitizing  the \ncoordinate values is called sampling. Digitizing the amplitude values is called quantization. \n \nFigure 1.3 Continues image, A scan line from A to B in the continues image, Sampling and quantization, Digital Scan line  \nWWW.VTULOOP.COM","metadata":{"source":"D:\\WebDev\\vtugpt-next\\pages\\api\\documents\\Module 1 [www.vtuloop.com] (1).pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.5","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Title":"Digital Image Processing                                                                                                          Module 1","Author":"Sandesh","Creator":"Microsoft® Word 2016","Producer":"www.ilovepdf.com","CreationDate":"D:20180918114405+00'00'","ModDate":"D:20180918114405Z"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":14},"loc":{"pageNumber":6}}}],["8bfaf6a6-481f-40f3-adb5-8af003be675c",{"pageContent":"7 \nDigital Image Processing                                                                                                          Module 1 \n \nwritetokaranth@gmail.com1| rkk4691@gmail.com\n \n                                                        | VCET, Puttur \n \n In fig. 1.3(a) shows a continuous image f that we want to convert to digital form. The one \ndimensional  function in  fig. 1.3(b)  is  a  plot  of  amplitude  values  of  the  continuous  image  along \nthe line segment AB in fig. 1.3(a). The random variations are due to image noise. To sample this \nfunction, we take equally  spaced  samples along the  line  AB, as  shown  in fig.1.3(c). The spatial \nlocation of each sample is indicated by a vertical tick mark in the bottom part of the figure. The \nsamples  are  shown  as  small  white  squares  superimposed  on  the  function.  The  set  of  these \ndiscrete  locations  gives  the  sampled  function. In  order  to  form  a  digital  function,  the  intensity \nvalues also must be converted into discrete quantities. The right side of the fig. 1.3(c) shows the \nintensity  scale divided  into eight discrete intervals, ranging  from black to white. The vertical tic \nmarks indicate the specific value assigned to each of the eight intensity intervals. The continuous \nintensity  levels are  quantized  by  assigning  one  of  the  eight  values  to  each  sample.  The  digital \nsamples resulting from both sampling and quantization are shown in fig 1.3(d).  \nRepresenting Digital Images \n Let f(s, t) represent a continuous image function of two continuous variables, s and t. We \nconvert this  function  into a digital  image by sampling and quantization. Suppose we sample the \ncontinuous  image  into  a  2-D  array,  f(x,y),  containing  M  rows  and  N  columns,  where  (x,y)  are \ndiscrete  coordinates. For  notational  clarity and  convenience,  we  use  integer  values  for  these \ndiscrete  coordinates:  x  =  0,1,2,3,...M-1  and  y  =  0,1,2,3,.....N-1. In  general,  the  value  of  the \nimage  at  any  coordinates  (x,y)  is  denoted  f(x,y),  where  x  and  y  are  integers.  The  section  of  the \nreal  plane  spanned by  the  coordinates  of  an  image  is  called  the spatial  domain, with  x  and  y \nbeing referred to as spatial variables or spatial coordinates.  The image displays allow us to view \nresults at a glance. Numerical arrays are used for processing and algorithm development.  \n In equation form, we write the representation of an M X N numerical array as \n \nWWW.VTULOOP.COM","metadata":{"source":"D:\\WebDev\\vtugpt-next\\pages\\api\\documents\\Module 1 [www.vtuloop.com] (1).pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.5","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Title":"Digital Image Processing                                                                                                          Module 1","Author":"Sandesh","Creator":"Microsoft® Word 2016","Producer":"www.ilovepdf.com","CreationDate":"D:20180918114405+00'00'","ModDate":"D:20180918114405Z"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":14},"loc":{"pageNumber":7}}}],["ce05960a-06fc-4198-9d62-f52c9bdf3d65",{"pageContent":"8 \nDigital Image Processing                                                                                                          Module 1 \n \nwritetokaranth@gmail.com1| rkk4691@gmail.com\n \n                                                        | VCET, Puttur \n \n Both  the  sides  of  this  equation  are  equivalent  ways  of  expressing  a  digital  image \nquantitatively.

In  nuclear  medicine,  the  approach is  to  inject  a  patient with  a \nradioactive isotope that emits gamma rays as it decays. Images are produced from the emissions \ncollected by gamma ray detectors. \nX-ray Imaging: X-rays are among the oldest sources of EM radiation used for imaging. The best \nknown  use  of  X-rays  is  medical  diagnostics,  but  they  also  are  used  extensively in  industry  and \nother areas, like astronomy. X-rays for medical and industrial imaging are generated using an X-\nray tube, which is a vacuum tube with a cathode and anode. The cathode is heated, causing free \nelectrons  to  be released.  These  electrons  flow  at  high  speed  to  the  positively  charged  anode.  \nWhen the electrons strike  a nucleus, energy  is released  in the  form of X-ray radiation. e energy \n(penetrating  power)  of  the  X-rays  is controlled  by  a  voltage applied  across  the  anode,  and  the \nnumber of X-rays is controlled by a current applied to the filament in the cathode.

In \ndigital radiography, digital images are obtained by one of two methods: \n (1) By digitizing X-ray films;  \n (2) by having the X-rays that pass through the patient fall directly onto devices (such as a \nphosphor screen) that convert X-rays to light.  \nRobot Vision:  \nApart from the many challenges that a robot face today, one of the biggest challenge still \nis to increase the vision of the robot.
