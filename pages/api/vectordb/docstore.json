An image is captured by \na  sensor  (such  as  digital  camera)  and  digitized.  The  image  that  is acquired  is completely \nunprocessed. This step involves preprocessing such as scaling.  \nImage  enhancement: It is  the  process  of  manipulating  an  image  in  order  to  make image  more \nsuitable than the original  for the specific application. The  image enhancement techniques are so \nverified, and use so many different image processing approaches. The idea behind enhancement \ntechniques  is to bring out detail that is  hidden, or simply to highlight certain  features of  interest \nin an image like changing brightness & contrast etc. \nImage restoration: It is an area that also deals with improving the appearance of an image but it \nis  objective  than  subjective,  in  the  sense  that  restoration  techniques  tend  to  be  based  on \nmathematical or probabilistic models of image degradation.  \nColor  image  processing: It  is  an  area  that  has  been  gaining  in  importance  because  of  the \nsignificant increase in the use of digital images over the internet. Color is used also for extracting \nfeatures  of  interest  in  an  image. This  may  include  color  modeling  and  processing  in  a  digital \ndomain etc.  \nWWW.VTULOOP.COM","metadata":{"source":"D:\\WebDev\\vtugpt-next\\public\\documents\\Module 1 [www.vtuloop.com] (1).pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.5","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Title":"Digital Image Processing                                                                                                          Module 1","Author":"Sandesh","Creator":"Microsoft® Word 2016","Producer":"www.ilovepdf.com","CreationDate":"D:20180918114405+00'00'","ModDate":"D:20180918114405Z"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":14},"loc":{"pageNumber":2}}}],["e3975181-5f68-4f65-8965-3fcb4efe3fd9",{"pageContent":"3 \nDigital Image Processing                                                                                                          Module 1 \n \nwritetokaranth@gmail.com1| rkk4691@gmail.com\n \n                                                        | VCET, Puttur \n \nWavelets: These  are  the  foundation  for  representing  images  in  various  degrees  of  resolution.  In \nparticular  used  for  image  data  compression  and  for  pyramidal  representation,  in  which  images \nare subdivided successively into smaller regions.  \nCompression: Deals with techniques for reducing the storage required to saving an image, or the \nbandwidth  required  to  transmit  it.  An  example  for  image  compression  standard is  jpg  file \nextension used in the JPEG(Joint Photographic Experts Group) image compression standard. \nMorphological processing: It deals with tools for extracting image components that are useful in \nthe representation and description of shape.  \nSegmentation: Segmentation procedures partition an image into its constituent’s parts or objects. \nIn  general,  autonomous  segmentation  is  one  of  the  most  difficult  task  in  digital  processing.  A \nrugged  segmentation  procedure  brings  the  process  a  long  way  towards  successful  solution  of \nimaging  problems  that require  objects to  be  identified  individually. On  the other  hand,  weak  or \nerratic segmentation algorithms always guarantee eventual failure.  \nRepresentation  and  description: It  follows  the  output  of  the  segmentation  stage,  which  is  raw \npixel data it’s needed to convert it to a form suitable for computer processing. The first decision \nthat must be made is whether the data should be represented as a boundary (i.e., the set of pixels \nseparating one image region from another) or as a complete region. \n The  boundary  representation  is  appropriate  when  the  focus  is  on  external  shape \ncharacteristics, such as corners and inflections. \n The regional representation is appropriate when the focus is on internal properties, such \nas texture or skeletal shape. \nDescription  also  called  feature  selection,  deals  with  extracting  attributes  that  result  in  some \nquantitative  information  of  interest  or  are  basic  for  differentiating  one  class  of  objects  from \nanother. \nRecognition: It  is  the process  that  assigns a  label  (e.g.,  ‘vehicle’) to  an  object  based  on  its \ndescriptors.  \n \nWWW.VTULOOP.COM","metadata":{"source":"D:\\WebDev\\vtugpt-next\\public\\documents\\Module 1 [www.vtuloop.com] (1).pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.5","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Title":"Digital Image Processing                                                                                                          Module 1","Author":"Sandesh","Creator":"Microsoft® Word 2016","Producer":"www.ilovepdf.com","CreationDate":"D:20180918114405+00'00'","ModDate":"D:20180918114405Z"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":14},"loc":{"pageNumber":3}}}],["7dbc5ba0-c572-49dd-a4fd-a9784002700b",{"pageContent":"4 \nDigital Image Processing                                                                                                          Module 1 \n \nwritetokaranth@gmail.com1| rkk4691@gmail.com\n \n                                                        | VCET, Puttur \n \nComponents of an Image Processing System** \n Network \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nProblem domain \nFigure 1.2 Components of a general – purpose image processing system. \nThe above figure shows the basic components comprising a typical general purpose system used \nfor  digital  image  processing.

This  type  of  hardware  is  called  a front  end \nsubsystem, and its most distinguished characteristic is speed, so this unit performs functions that \nrequire fast data throughputs that the typical main computer cannot handle.  \nThe Computer in an  image processing system  is a general purpose computer and can range \nfrom a PC to a supercomputer. In dedicated applications, sometimes custom computers are used \nto achieve a required level of performance.  \nSoftware for image processing consists of specialized modules that perform specific tasks. A \nwell designed package also  includes the capacity  for the user to write code that, as a minimum, \nutilizes the specialized modules.  \nMass  storage capacity  is  a  must  in image  processing  applications.  An  image  1024  X  1024 \npixels, in which the intensity of each pixel is an 8-bit quantity, requires one megabyte of storage \nspace if the image is not compressed. When dealing with thousands, or even millions, of images, \nproviding  adequate  storage  in  an  image  processing  applications  falls  into  three  principal \ncategories:  \n1. Short term storage for use during processing \n2. Online storage for relatively fast recall \n3. Archival storage, characterized by infrequent access.  \nStorage  is  measured  in  bytes,  Kbytes,  Mbytes,  Gbytes,  Tbytes.  One  method  of  providing \nshort  term  storage  is  computer  memory.  An-other  is  by  specialized  buffers,  that  store  one  or \nmore images and can be accessed rapidly, usually at video buffers, that store one or more images \nand   can   be   accessed rapidly,   usually   at   video   rates.  The   latter   method   allows   virtually \ninstantaneous  image  zoom,  as  well  as  scroll  (vertical  shifts)  and  pan  (horizontal  shifts).  Online \nstorage  generally  takes  the  form  of  magnetic  disks or  optical  image  storage.  The  key  factor \ncharacterizing the online storage is frequent access to the stored data. Magnetic tapes and optical \ndisks housed in ‘jukeboxes’ are the usual media for the archival applications.  \nWWW.VTULOOP.COM","metadata":{"source":"D:\\WebDev\\vtugpt-next\\public\\documents\\Module 1 [www.vtuloop.com] (1).pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.5","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Title":"Digital Image Processing                                                                                                          Module 1","Author":"Sandesh","Creator":"Microsoft® Word 2016","Producer":"www.ilovepdf.com","CreationDate":"D:20180918114405+00'00'","ModDate":"D:20180918114405Z"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":14},"loc":{"pageNumber":5}}}],["a76c3cb5-31df-424a-83a5-559a4b37d018",{"pageContent":"6 \nDigital Image Processing                                                                                                          Module 1 \n \nwritetokaranth@gmail.com1| rkk4691@gmail.com\n \n                                                        | VCET, Puttur \n \nImage  displays in  use  today  are  mainly  color  TV  monitors.  Monitors  are  driven  by  the \noutputs of  image  and  graphic  display  cards  that  are  an  integral  part  of  the  computer  system. In \nsome cases it is necessary to have stereo displays, and these are implemented in the form of head \ngear containing two small displays embedded in goggles worn by the users.  \nHardcopy devices  for  recording  images  include  laser  printers,  film  cameras,  heat-sensitive \ndevices,  inject  units,  such  as  optical  and  CD  ROM  disks.

To convert it to digital \nform,  we  have  sampled  the  function  in  both  coordinates  and  in  amplitude.  Digitizing  the \ncoordinate values is called sampling. Digitizing the amplitude values is called quantization. \n \nFigure 1.3 Continues image, A scan line from A to B in the continues image, Sampling and quantization, Digital Scan line  \nWWW.VTULOOP.COM","metadata":{"source":"D:\\WebDev\\vtugpt-next\\public\\documents\\Module 1 [www.vtuloop.com] (1).pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.5","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Title":"Digital Image Processing                                                                                                          Module 1","Author":"Sandesh","Creator":"Microsoft® Word 2016","Producer":"www.ilovepdf.com","CreationDate":"D:20180918114405+00'00'","ModDate":"D:20180918114405Z"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":14},"loc":{"pageNumber":6}}}],["afb38d19-cd32-4c04-951d-9e3ff9775b81",{"pageContent":"7 \nDigital Image Processing                                                                                                          Module 1 \n \nwritetokaranth@gmail.com1| rkk4691@gmail.com\n \n                                                        | VCET, Puttur \n \n In fig. 1.3(a) shows a continuous image f that we want to convert to digital form. The one \ndimensional  function in  fig. 1.3(b)  is  a  plot  of  amplitude  values  of  the  continuous  image  along \nthe line segment AB in fig. 1.3(a). The random variations are due to image noise. To sample this \nfunction, we take equally  spaced  samples along the  line  AB, as  shown  in fig.1.3(c). The spatial \nlocation of each sample is indicated by a vertical tick mark in the bottom part of the figure. The \nsamples  are  shown  as  small  white  squares  superimposed  on  the  function.  The  set  of  these \ndiscrete  locations  gives  the  sampled  function. In  order  to  form  a  digital  function,  the  intensity \nvalues also must be converted into discrete quantities. The right side of the fig. 1.3(c) shows the \nintensity  scale divided  into eight discrete intervals, ranging  from black to white. The vertical tic \nmarks indicate the specific value assigned to each of the eight intensity intervals. The continuous \nintensity  levels are  quantized  by  assigning  one  of  the  eight  values  to  each  sample.  The  digital \nsamples resulting from both sampling and quantization are shown in fig 1.3(d).  \nRepresenting Digital Images \n Let f(s, t) represent a continuous image function of two continuous variables, s and t. We \nconvert this  function  into a digital  image by sampling and quantization. Suppose we sample the \ncontinuous  image  into  a  2-D  array,  f(x,y),  containing  M  rows  and  N  columns,  where  (x,y)  are \ndiscrete  coordinates. For  notational  clarity and  convenience,  we  use  integer  values  for  these \ndiscrete  coordinates:  x  =  0,1,2,3,...M-1  and  y  =  0,1,2,3,.....N-1. In  general,  the  value  of  the \nimage  at  any  coordinates  (x,y)  is  denoted  f(x,y),  where  x  and  y  are  integers.  The  section  of  the \nreal  plane  spanned by  the  coordinates  of  an  image  is  called  the spatial  domain, with  x  and  y \nbeing referred to as spatial variables or spatial coordinates.  The image displays allow us to view \nresults at a glance. Numerical arrays are used for processing and algorithm development.  \n In equation form, we write the representation of an M X N numerical array as \n \nWWW.VTULOOP.COM","metadata":{"source":"D:\\WebDev\\vtugpt-next\\public\\documents\\Module 1 [www.vtuloop.com] (1).pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.5","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Title":"Digital Image Processing                                                                                                          Module 1","Author":"Sandesh","Creator":"Microsoft® Word 2016","Producer":"www.ilovepdf.com","CreationDate":"D:20180918114405+00'00'","ModDate":"D:20180918114405Z"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":14},"loc":{"pageNumber":7}}}],["3b4c83c7-1c5d-4bf3-8911-2de1eda0549c",{"pageContent":"8 \nDigital Image Processing                                                                                                          Module 1 \n \nwritetokaranth@gmail.com1| rkk4691@gmail.com\n \n                                                        | VCET, Puttur \n \n Both  the  sides  of  this  equation  are  equivalent  ways  of  expressing  a  digital  image \nquantitatively.

In  nuclear  medicine,  the  approach is  to  inject  a  patient with  a \nradioactive isotope that emits gamma rays as it decays. Images are produced from the emissions \ncollected by gamma ray detectors. \nX-ray Imaging: X-rays are among the oldest sources of EM radiation used for imaging. The best \nknown  use  of  X-rays  is  medical  diagnostics,  but  they  also  are  used  extensively in  industry  and \nother areas, like astronomy. X-rays for medical and industrial imaging are generated using an X-\nray tube, which is a vacuum tube with a cathode and anode. The cathode is heated, causing free \nelectrons  to  be released.  These  electrons  flow  at  high  speed  to  the  positively  charged  anode.  \nWhen the electrons strike  a nucleus, energy  is released  in the  form of X-ray radiation. e energy \n(penetrating  power)  of  the  X-rays  is controlled  by  a  voltage applied  across  the  anode,  and  the \nnumber of X-rays is controlled by a current applied to the filament in the cathode.

Frequency\ndomain processing techniques are basedon modifying the Fourier transform of an image.\nThe term  spatial domain refers to the aggregate ofpixels composing an image. Spatial\ndomain methods are procedures that operatedirectly on these pixels. Spatial domain processes\nwill be denoted by theexpression\ng (x, y) = T [f (x, y)]\nwhere f(x, y) is the input image, g(x, y) is the processed image, and T is anoperator on f,\ndefined over some neighborhood of (x, y). In addition,T can operateon a  set of input images,\nsuch as performing the pixel-by-pixel sum of Kimages for noise reduction. \nThe principal approach in defining a neighborhood about a point (x, y) is to use a square\nor rectangular subimage area centered at (x, y), as shown in below figure 1.\nFigure 1: 3*3neighborhoodabout a point (x, y) in an image.\nwritetokaranth@gmail.com1| rkk4691@gmail.com| VCET, Puttur\nWWW.VTULOOP.COM","metadata":{"source":"D:\\WebDev\\vtugpt-next\\public\\documents\\Module 2 [www.vtuloop.com].pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.4","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Title":"IMAGE ENHANCEMENT IN THE SPATIAL DOMAIN                                                            Module 2","Author":"Sandesh","Creator":"Writer","Producer":"LibreOffice 4.2","CreationDate":"D:20180927091141+02'00'"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":27},"loc":{"pageNumber":1}}}],["c03832ba-802e-4244-8fb5-189eacd6ad65",{"pageContent":"2\nIMAGE ENHANCEMENT IN THE SPATIAL DOMAIN                                             \nModule 2\nThe center of the subimage is moved from pixel to pixel starting, say, at the topleft\ncorner.The operator T is applied at each location (x, y) to yield the output,g, at that location.The\nprocess utilizes only the pixels in the area of the image spanned by the neighborhood.Although\nother neighborhood shapes, such as approximations to a circle, sometimes are used, square and\nrectangular arrays areby far the most predominant because of their ease of implementation.\nThe simplest form of T is when the neighborhood is of size 1*1 (that is, asingle pixel).

Use the pre-computed values\nfrom Steps (2) and (4) for these mappings.\nEnhancement Using Arithmetic/Logic Operations\nArithmetic/logic operations  involving images  are  performed on a  pixel-by-pixel basis\nbetween two or more images (this excludes the logic operation NOT, which is performed on a\nsingle   image).Logic   operations   similarly   operate   on   a   pixel-by-pixel   basis.We  need   onlybe\nconcerned with the ability to implement the AND, OR, and NOT logic operators because these\nthree   operators   are  functionally   complete.When   dealing   with   logic   operations   on   gray-scale\nimages, pixel valuesare processed as strings of binary numbers. For example, performing the\nNOToperation on a black, 8-bit pixel (a string of eight 0’s) produces a white pixel(a string of\neight 1’s). Intermediate values are processed the same way, changing all 1’s to 0’s and vice versa.\nThe four arithmetic operations, subtraction and addition (in that order) arethe most useful\nfor image enhancement. \nImage Subtraction:\nThe difference between two images f(x, y) and h(x, y), expressed as\ng(x, y) = f(x, y) - h(x, y),\nAnd it is obtained by computing the difference between all pairs of corresponding pixels from f\nand h. The key usefulness of subtraction is the enhancement of differences between images. \nOne of the most commercially successful and beneficial uses of image subtraction is in\nthe area of medical imaging called mask mode radiography. In thiscase h(x, y), the mask, is an\nX-ray image of a region of a patient’s body capturedby an intensified TV camera (instead of\ntraditional X-ray film) located oppositean X-ray source.The procedure consists of injecting a\ncontrast   medium     into   the   patient’s   blood   stream,   taking   a   series   of   images   of   the   same\nanatomical regionas h(x, y), and subtracting this mask  from the series of incoming imagesafter\ninjection of the contrast medium.

All this says is that our focus in the following discussionwill be on\nmasks of odd sizes, with the smallest meaningful size being 3*3 (weexclude from our discussion\nthe trivial case of a 1*1 mask).\nIn general, linear filtering of an image f of size M*N with a filter mask ofsize m*n is\ngiven by the expression:\nwhere, from the previous paragraph, a=(m-1)/2 and b=(n-1)/2.

Noise reduction can be accomplished by\nblurring with a linear filter and also by nonlinear filtering.\nSmoothing Linear Filters:\nThe output (response) of a smoothing, linear spatial filter is simply the averageof the\npixels   contained   in   the   neighborhood   of   the   filter   mask.

Because\nrandom noise typically consists ofsharp transitions in gray levels, the most obvious application of\nsmoothing isnoise reduction. However, edges (which almost always are desirable features of\nan image) also are characterized by sharp transitions in gray levels, so averagingfilters have the\nundesirable side effect that they blur edges. \nA major use of averaging filters is in the reduction of “irrelevant” detail in animage. By\n“irrelevant” we mean pixel regions that are small with respect to thesize of the filter mask.The\nFigure  shows two 3*3 smoothing filters. Use of the first filter yields thestandard average of the\npixels under the mask.\nThis is the average of the gray levels of the pixels in the 3*3 neighborhood defined by the mask.\nNote that, instead of being 1_9, the coefficients of the filterare all 1’s. An m*n mask would have\na normalizing constant equal to 1_mn. A spatial averaging filter in which all coefficients are\nequal is sometimes calleda box filter.\nFigure 9 Two 3*3 smoothing (averaging) filter masks. The constant multiplier in front of each mask is equal to the sum of\nthe values of its coefficients, as is required to compute an average.\nThe second mask shown in Fig. 9 is a little more interesting.

In the\nmask shown in Fig. 9(b) the pixel at the center of the mask is multiplied by a higher value than\nany other, thus giving this pixel more importance in the calculation of the average.The other\npixelsare inversely weighted as a function of their distance from the center of the mask.\nThe general implementation  for filtering an M*N image with a weighted averaging filter\nof size m*n (m and  n odd) is given by the expression\nwritetokaranth@gmail.com1| rkk4691@gmail.com| VCET, Puttur\nWWW.VTULOOP.COM","metadata":{"source":"D:\\WebDev\\vtugpt-next\\public\\documents\\Module 2 [www.vtuloop.com].pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.4","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Title":"IMAGE ENHANCEMENT IN THE SPATIAL DOMAIN                                                            Module 2","Author":"Sandesh","Creator":"Writer","Producer":"LibreOffice 4.2","CreationDate":"D:20180927091141+02'00'"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":27},"loc":{"pageNumber":16}}}],["1b777ed8-f6e3-4b91-9eb5-5cc1bf3957f7",{"pageContent":"17\nIMAGE ENHANCEMENT IN THE SPATIAL DOMAIN                                             \nModule 2\nFor x=0, 1, 2, p , M-1 and y=0, 1, 2, p , N-1.\nOrder-Statistics Filters\nOrder-statistics filters are nonlinear spatial filters whose response is based on ordering\n(ranking) the pixels contained in the image area encompassed by the filter, and then replacing the\nvalue of the center pixel with the value determined by the ranking result.\nThe best-known example in this category is the median filter, which, as its name implies,\nreplaces the value of a pixel by the median of the gray levels in the neighborhood of that pixel\n(the original value of the pixel is included in the computation of the median). Median filters are\nquite popular because, for certain types of random noise, they provide excellent noise-reduction\ncapabilities, with considerably less blurring than linear smoothing filters of similar size. Median\nfilters are particularly effective in the presence of impulse noise, also called salt-and-pepper\nnoise because of its appearance as white and black dots superimposed on an image. The median,\nj, of a set of values is such that half the values in the set are less than or equal to j, and half are\ngreater than or equal to j. In order to perform median filtering at a point in an image, we first sort\nthe values of the pixel in question and its neighbors, determine their median, and assign this\nvalue to that pixel. For example, in a 3*3 neighborhood the median is the 5th largest value, in a\n5*5 neighborhood the 13th largest value, and so on.When several valuesin a neighborhood are\nthe same, all equal values are grouped.\n For example, suppose that a 3*3 neighborhood has values (10, 20, 20, 20, 15, 20, 20, 25,\n100). These values are sorted as (10, 15, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 25, 100), which results in a median of\n20. Thus, the principal function of median filters is to force points with distinct gray levels to be\nmore like their neighbors. In fact, isolated clusters of pixels that are light or dark with respect to\ntheir neighbors, and whose area is less than n\n2\n/2 (one-half the filter area), are eliminated by an\nn*n   median   filter.   In   this   case   “eliminated”   means   forced   to   the   median   intensity   of   the\nneighbors. Larger clusters are affected considerably less. Although the median filter is by far the\nmost useful order-statistics filter in image processing, it is by no means the only one. The median\nrepresents the 50th percentile of a ranked set of numbers, but the reader will recall from basic\nstatistics   that   ranking   lends   itself   to   many  other   possibilities.

The derivatives\nof a digital function are defined in terms of differences. There are various ways to define these\ndifferences. However, we require that any definition we use for a first derivative (1) must be zero\nin flat segments (areas of constant gray-level values); (2) must be nonzero at the onset of a gray-\nlevel step or ramp; and (3) must be nonzero along ramps. Similarly, any definition of a second\nderivative (1) must be zero in flat areas; (2) must be nonzero at the onset and end of a gray-level\nstep or ramp; and (3) must be zero along ramps of constant slope.\nA basic definition of the first-order derivative of a one-dimensional function f(x)\nis the difference\nSimilarly, we define a second-order derivative as the difference\nIt   is   easily   verified   that   these   two   definitions   satisfy   the   conditions   stated\npreviouslyregarding derivatives of the first and second order. \nwritetokaranth@gmail.com1| rkk4691@gmail.com| VCET, Puttur\nWWW.VTULOOP.COM","metadata":{"source":"D:\\WebDev\\vtugpt-next\\public\\documents\\Module 2 [www.vtuloop.com].pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.4","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Title":"IMAGE ENHANCEMENT IN THE SPATIAL DOMAIN                                                            Module 2","Author":"Sandesh","Creator":"Writer","Producer":"LibreOffice 4.2","CreationDate":"D:20180927091141+02'00'"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":27},"loc":{"pageNumber":18}}}],["fd10785b-d3ce-42a9-8c19-407becaa8efe",{"pageContent":"19\nIMAGE ENHANCEMENT IN THE SPATIAL DOMAIN                                             \nModule 2\nFigure 10 Simplified profile (the points are joined by dashed lines to simplify\ninterpretation).\nFigure 10 shows a simplification of the profile, with just enough numbers to make it\npossible for us to analyze how the first- and second-order derivativesbehave as they encounter a\nnoise point, a line, and then the edge of anobject.

The narrow dynamic range of the gray levels and high\nnoise content make this image difficult to enhance. The strategy we will follow is to utilize the\nLaplacian to highlight fine detail, and the gradient to enhance prominent edges.\nFigure 13(b) shows the Laplacian of the original image. We can obtain a sharpened image\nat this pointsimply by adding Figs. 13(a) and (b), which are an implementation of the second line\nin Eq. (5) (we used a mask with a positive center coefficient). Just by looking at the noise level in\n(b), we would expect a rather noisy sharpened image if we added Figs. 13(a) and (b), a fact that\nis confirmed by the result shown in Fig. 13(c). One way that comes immediately to mind to\nreduce the  noise is  to use a median  filter. However, median filtering  is  a nonlinear process\ncapable of removing image features. This is unacceptable in medical image processing.\nFigure   13(d)   shows   the   Sobel   gradient   of   the   original   image,   computed   using   Eq.   (14).\nComponents Gx and Gy were obtained using the masks in Figs. 14(d) and (e), respectively. The\nfact that Figs. 13(d) and (e) are much brighter than Fig. 13(b) is again evidence that the gradient\nof   an   image   with   significant   edge   content   has   values   that   are   higher   in   general   than   in   a\nLaplacian image. The product of the Laplacian and smoothed-gradient image is shown in Fig.\n13(f). Note the dominance of the strong edges and the relative lack of visible noise, which is the\nkey objective behind masking the Laplacian with a smoothed gradient image. Adding the product\nimage to the original resulted in the sharpened image shown in Fig. 13(g).\nFigure 13: (a) Image of whole body bone scan. (b) Laplacian of (a).

This  result  is  known  as  the  sampling \ntheorem.  No  information  is  lost  if  a  continues,  band  limited  function  is  represented  by  samples \nacquired at a rate greater than twice the highest frequency content of the function. Conversely, it \ncan state that the maximum frequency that can be ‘captured’ by sampling a signal at a rate 1/∆T \nis 휇 \nmax \n= 1/2∆T.  \n   \nAliasing \n If  a  band  limited  function  is  sampled  at  a  rate  that  is  less  than  the  twice  its  highest \nfrequency  then  it  corresponds to  the  under-sampling. If  a  band  limited  function  is  sampled  at  a \nrate  that  is  equal  to  the  twice  its  highest  frequency  then  it  results  to  the  critical-sampling. If  a \nband limited function is sampled at a rate that is more than the twice its highest frequency then it \nresults to the over-sampling. \n The  effect  that  caused  by  under-sampling  a  function,  is  known  as  frequency  aliasing  or \nsimply  as  aliasing.  In  words,  aliasing  is  a  process  in  which  high  frequency  components  of  a \ncontinues  function  “masquerade”  as  lower  frequencies  in  the  sampled  function. Suppose,  we \nwant to limit the duration of a band-limited function f(t) to an interval, say [0, T]. We can do this \nby multiplying f(t) by the function, as shown below.  \nWWW.VTULOOP.COM","metadata":{"source":"D:\\WebDev\\vtugpt-next\\public\\documents\\Module 3 [www.vtuloop.com].pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.7","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Creator":"Microsoft® Word for Office 365","Producer":"Microsoft® Word for Office 365","CreationDate":"D:20181102083847+00'00'","ModDate":"D:20181102083847+00'00'"},"metadata":{"_metadata":{"pdf:producer":"Microsoft® Word for Office 365","xmp:creatortool":"Microsoft® Word for Office 365","xmp:createdate":"2018-11-02T08:38:47+00:00","xmp:modifydate":"2018-11-02T08:38:47+00:00","xmpmm:documentid":"uuid:2A59F63A-C62E-4255-8294-D5E3D6D1FDF1","xmpmm:instanceid":"uuid:2A59F63A-C62E-4255-8294-D5E3D6D1FDF1"}},"totalPages":20},"loc":{"pageNumber":6}}}],["e5966af6-6b04-46e9-bc9e-4dc960806b44",{"pageContent":"7 \nIMAHE ENHANCEMENT IN THE FREQUENCY DOMAIN                                                     Module 3                                                           \n \nwritetokaranth@gmail.com1| rkk4691@gmail.com\n \n                                                        | VCET, Puttur \n \nh(t) = {1    if 0≤ t ≤ T,    0   otherwise} \n \n If  the  transform  of  f(t)  is  the  band-limited,  convolving  it  with  H(휇),  which  involves \nsliding one function across the other, will yield a result with frequency components extending to \ninfinity.  Therefore,  no  function  of  finite  duration  can  be  band-limited.  Conversely,  a  function \nthat is band-limited must extend from -∞ to ∞.  \n In  practice,  the  effects  of  aliasing  can  be  reduced  by  smoothing  the  input  function  to \nattenuate  its  higher  frequencies.  This  process  is  called  anti-aliasing,  has  to  be  done  before  the \nfunction its sampled because aliasing is a sampling issue that cannot be “undone after the fact” \nusing computational technique. The below figure  shows the classic example of aliasing. A pure \nsign wave extending infinitely in both directions has a single frequency so, its band-limited and \nhaving  a  frequency  much  lower  than  the  frequency  of  the  continuous signal.  The period of  the \nsine  wave  is  2s,  so  the  zero  crossings  of  the  horizontal  axis  occur  every  second.  ∆T  is  the \nseparation between samples.  \n \nFunction reconstruction from sampled data   \n The  reconstruction  of  a  function  from  a  set  of  its  samples  reduces  in  practice  to \ninterpolating between the samples.

Image  compression  is  used  in  many  applications  like  televideo  conferencing,  remote \nsensing, document and medical imaging, and facsimile transmission (FAX).  \nFundamentals:  \n The  data  compression  refers  to  the  process  of  reducing  the  amount  of  data  required to \nrepresent  a  given  quantity  of  information.  Here  data  and  information  are  not  the  same,  data  are \nthe mean by which information is conveyed and various amounts of data can be used to represent \nthe same amount of information. The data can have irrelevant or repeated information are called \nredundant data.  \n  If    we  let  b  and  b’  denote    the number  of  bits  in  two  representations  of  the  same  \ninformation, the relative data redundancy R of the representation with b bits is  \n      R = 1 – 1/C  \nWhere C, commonly called the compression ratio, is defined as  \n      C = b/b’  \nThe principle types of data redundancy that can be identified as: \n1. Coding  redundancy:  A  code  is  a  system  of  symbols  used  to  represent  a  body  of \ninformation or set of events.

Interpixel redundancy depends on the \nresolution  of  the  image The  higher  the  (spatial)  resolution  of  an  image,  the  more  probable  it  is \nthat two  neighboring  pixels  will  depict  the  same  object. The  higher  the  frame  rate  in  a  video \nstream, the more probable it is that the corresponding pixel in the following frame will depict the \nsame object these types of predictions are made more difficult by the presence of noise \n \nImage Compression Model \n The  following  figure  shows  an  image  compression  system  is  composed  of  two  distinct \nfunctional  components:  an  encoder  and  decoder.  The  encoder  performs  compression    and \ndecoder  performs  the  complementary  operation  of  decompression.  Both  operations  can  be \nperformed in software.  \n Input  image is  fed  into  the  encoder,  which  creates  a  compressed  representation  of  the \ninput.  When  the  compressed  representation  is presented  to  its  complementary  decoder,  a \nreconstructed image is generated.  \n \nWWW.VTULOOP.COM","metadata":{"source":"D:\\WebDev\\vtugpt-next\\public\\documents\\Module 5 [www.vtuloop.com].pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.5","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Title":"IMAGE COMPRESSION                                                                                                                Module 5","Author":"Sandesh","Creator":"","Producer":"https://www.convertapi.com","CreationDate":"D:20190102082430+02'00'","ModDate":"D:20190102082432+02'00'"},"metadata":{"_metadata":{"pdf:keywords":"","pdf:producer":"Neevia Document Converter Pro v6.9 (http://neevia.com)","xmp:modifydate":"2019-01-02T08:24:31+02:00","xmp:createdate":"2019-01-02T08:24:30+02:00","xmp:metadatadate":"2019-01-02T08:24:30+02:00","xmp:creatortool":"Microsoft Word v16","dc:format":"application/pdf","dc:description":"","dc:creator":"Sandesh","dc:title":"IMAGE COMPRESSION                                                                                                                Module 5","xmpmm:documentid":"uuid:E63D66EB-5161-79E5-9E42-1B84BBBFF02C","xmpmm:instanceid":"uuid:5ED754A9-D84B-1B4A-CE2D-4F072FC497B9"}},"totalPages":14},"loc":{"pageNumber":3}}}],["3f44c81e-d217-4797-af80-958d200fbe89",{"pageContent":"4 \nIMAGE COMPRESSION                                                                                                                Module 5 \n \nwritetokaranth@gmail.com1| rkk4691@gmail.com\n \n                                                        | VCET, Puttur \n \n \n \n Mapper - transforms  the  image  to  a  (non-visual)  format  designed  to  reduce interpixel \nredundancies.

When there are few runs of identical pixels, run length encoding \nresults  in  data  expansion.  The  BMP  file  format  uses  a  form  of  rum-length  encoding  In  which \nimage data is represented in two different modes :  \n1. Encoded  mode – A  two  byte  RLE  representation  is  used.  The  first  byte  specifies  the \nnumber of consecutive pixels that have the color index contained in the second byte. The \n8 bit color index selects the run’s intensity from a table of 256 possible intensities. \n2. Absolute mode – The first byte here is 0 and the second byte signals one of four possible \nconditions, as shown in below table.  \n \nFigure : BMP absolute coding mode options. In this mode, the first byte of the BMP pair is 0 \nTransform Coding \nIn  transform  coding  a  linear  transform  is  used  to  map  the  image  data  into  a  set of \ntransform  coefficients  (which  are  then  quantized  and  coded). For  reasons  of  computational \ncomplexity   the   image   is subdivided   into   smaller subimages   before   the   transformation \ncomputation. The goal of the transformation process is to decorrelate (minimize the variance) \nthe  pixels  of  the  subimages  as  much  as  possible. This  will  result  in  a  localization  of  the  image \ninformation in a minimal number of transform coefficients - the transformation coefficients with \nlittle data can then be more coarsely quantized or eliminated.
